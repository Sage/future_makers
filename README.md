# Sage FutureMakers Code Examples

Welcome the the Sage Future Makers Github repository. This is where you'll find code examples to help with connecting your Chatfuel Chatbot with Microsoft's Congnitive Services. 

We also have a getting started guide to help you with setting up your computer and running the code. 

## Examples
We have several examples for you to look at:

* Translation ([text_analytics.py](https://github.com/Sage/future_makers/blob/master/translation.py))
* Vision ([vision.py](https://github.com/Sage/future_makers/blob/master/vision.py))
* Face Detection ([face.py](https://github.com/Sage/future_makers/blob/master/face.py))

### Getting the examples
1. Download this [zip file](https://github.com/Sage/future_makers/archive/master.zip) to your desktop
1. Double-click on the zip file
1. Drag the folder to your desktop
1. Open **Visual Studio Code**
1. Click File -> Open Folder and choose the **future_makers** folder on your desktop

### Running the examples
1. Double-click on any file you are interested in
1. You'll need a subscription key, one of the Sage volunteers will be able to provide you with one 
1. Just replace the variable **subscription_key** in the `constants.py` file
1. You may also have to change the host name (eg westcentralus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com) to match your Azure service
1. Click the Debug menu (at the top) and choose Start Debugging -> Python
1. Optional - try setting a breakpoint

### Ngrok
Ngrok provides a tunnel to your local machine so that it can receive messages from the internet. You'll need to run this to be able to connect Chatfuel to the code running on your machine.

1. Download this [zip file](https://bin.equinox.io/c/4VmDzA7iaHb/ngrok-stable-windows-amd64.zip) to your desktop
1. Double-click on the zip file
1. Drag the ngrok.exe to your desktop
1. Open Command Prompt (Start -> Run -> cmd)
1. Change to the Desktop folder (`cd %USERPROFILE%\Desktop`)
1. Open the ngrok Get Started [page](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started)
1. Your authtoken is shown in the example commands
1. Run the two commands (**remove the ./ from the front**):
    * ngrok authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE
    * ngrok http 3001
1. Leave the command open (you can minimise the window)
