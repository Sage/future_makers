# Sage FutureMakers

Welcome the the Sage Future Makers Github repository. Here you'll find all the resources and help you'll need for Sage FutureMakers. 

We've split the resources into two areas:

* python_examples: Python files to build on
* instructions: tutorials on setting up the tools we will need.

The main workshop instruction sheet is in instructions/WorkshopInstructions.pdf.
